**Self-portrait:**

This is my self-portrait which mainly includes ellipse, circle (a type of ellipse), rectangle, triangle, arc, and line commands.More detailedly, some arcs are closed by chord to draw shapes like the fringe and the lower lip. All the colors are achieved by using the command fill (R,G,B) with reference to online color picker. The stokeWeight is set to be strokeWeight (2) to make the lines seem stronger.
The effect of noStroke in some shapes is achived by seeting the stroke color same as the fill of the shape.

The interesting parts of my portrait are: 1. The changing color sun glasses. It is achieved by using the random command within the fill setting of the sun glasses: fill (237, random (55, 144), 14); In this way it will randomly change color within a certain range.
2. The blowing bubble gum. The radius of the bubble gum will change according to "mouseX" which is mapped from "0-width" to "10-80". Generally, the radius will increase when you move the mouse from left to right but the bubble will pop when your mouse is too right (mouseX >700).
