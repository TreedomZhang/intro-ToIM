**Name of the project:**

"Pen Delivery Machine"

**Detail Description**

This project contains two major parts: 1. A cross-like pen delivery machine and 2. The circuit.

The cross-like pen delivery machine part:

Step 1: A cross-like shape (r = 14cm) was cut out of cardboard. Four smaller rectangular (3cm * 2.5cm) pieces were cut and hotglued to the cross-like shape cardboard as pen holders. 

Step 2: Four pens's caps were hotglued to the four smaller rectangular pieces.

Step 3: A small square (2.5cm * 2.5cm) piece with a small hole in the center was cut and hotglued to the stepper motor through the hole.

Step 4: Use super glue to stick the cross-like shape to the small square piece (which was glued to the stepper motor).

Step 5: Now the pens, the cross-like pen holder, and the stepper motor all move together!

More detailedly, the sound for Morse code is achieved by 1. use different pitches to indicate different letter (for example C4 for R and A3 for I), 2. use different duration to indicate whether it's a dot (2000/8) or a dash (2000/4), 3. between each letter there will be a 0 note to indicate pause the duration is the same as a dot.

**Difficulties**

At first the sound was produced as I imagined after examination, I figured out that it's because although I designed the 0 note in the array, I didn't assign a durration in this case should be 2000/8 for it. And when I counted the number of the total individual tone I wanted to make I counted less than I intended. After fix that I was able to play a complete Morse Code.
