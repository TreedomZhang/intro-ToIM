The name of this project is "the Traffic Light Buster". It is composed of three LED lights, 6 wires, one temporary switch, three 330 ohm resistance, one 10k ohm, red board, the breadboard, and a USB connected to the laptop.

When the switch if off (buttonState=0), the traffic lights will function will- the red light, the yellow light and the green light go one after another in sequence and normal speed. When the switch is on (buttonState=1), the lights will shine fast without obvious order, which indicates that the traffic lights are damaged.

Here is the schematic:
