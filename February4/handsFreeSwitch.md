Name: 
“The Touch - Two Leaves in Love”

Inspiration: 
Back in high school, I had been always wondering what would have happened if there were two leaves on the same tree who fell in love with each other. Every day, they would be so quiet but happy to be so adjacent to each other. However, there was still something they constantly and silently expecting – the wind.

Production Process: 
Part One – Making Conductive Leaves and the Heart
Materials: A4 paper, Copper tape, Scissor, Colorful pens
Cut two rectangles out of one plain A4 paper. Draw one leave on each of them and then decorate. Stick the wide copper tape at the back of the decorated leaves. Then cut the leaves out. The heart is also made of plain A4 paper, painted in red. 
Part Two – Design the Circuit
Materials: Red board, Breadboard, three wires, tape, LED, USB wire, One resistance
Connect Red board with the laptop using the USB wire. Connect the red board with the breadboard using one wire (from 5v on red board to a random hole on the breadboard). Then, put the resistance and LED in series; make sure the longer legs of both components are closer to the 5v side than the ground side. Then attach two wires to two leaves respectively using tapes, one wire connected to the LED the other connected to the ground on the red board. When the two leaves touch because of the force exerted by blowing, the circuit is closed.

Obstacles: 
There are mainly two obstacles in the process. 
At first, I made the leaves out of very thin, sticky paper and the “branches” out of very narrow copper tape attached to the sticky side of the paper. This led to the situation that when blowing the two leaves, it was more possible for the sticky non-conductive paper part stick together with conductive leave part par apart. Confronting this, I changed the material of the leaves into plain paper and use larger copper tape and stuck them together and then cut them out. The problem was solved.
The next obstacle happened when I figured out the connection didn’t work that well. After some examination, I found out that the area taken by taping the wire to the copper side of leave was too big that sometimes although these two leaves touched, it wouldn’t light up the LEDs because some copper area will touch the tape area. Hence, I adjusted the width and the length of the tape and it worked better.
