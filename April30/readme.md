**The Matrix**

**Description**

In this project, I mainly use an array and an spotlight effect. More specifically. I create an array of text "0" and "1" and called the class
"Line". Visually, these green characters will move from the top to the bottom and since there are many of them so they create an effect that
resembles the iconic matrix image. Also by using the spot light effect, you are able to explore the image behind the green characters.
It is easy to figure out that it's a famous scene of the leading character.
