**The Matrix**

**Description**

In this project, I mainly used an array and an spotlight effect. More specifically. I created an array of text "0" and "1" and called the class
"Line". Visually, these green characters would move from the top to the bottom and since there were many of them so they created an effect that
resembled the iconic matrix image. Also by using the spot light effect, one could explore the image behind the green characters.
It is easy to figure out that it's a famous scene of the leading character.
