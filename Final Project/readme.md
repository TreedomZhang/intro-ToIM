**Final Project Draft Proposal**

In this project, I want to create a short game based on one of my previous assignment. Here is the link to that:https://github.com/TreedomZhang/intro-ToIM/tree/master/April7
The previous project mainly includes a bug eating candies and as it eats more, its body will get bigger and the score board will reflect the number of the cadies eaten.

In the future version I want to accomplish four more major points:

1. The color of the bug can be chosen based on the user's preference at the beginning of this game, a color palette will be provided.

2. There will be multiple scenes to make the game more complete: eg. the game openning scene, the color choosing scene, the instruction scene, and the ending scene.

3. The position of the bug will be the position of the user's mouth use the video function instead of the position of the mouse.
