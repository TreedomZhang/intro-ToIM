**TEN SMALLEST COUNTRIES**

**Description**

In this assignment, you can press keys (1,2,3....9,0) to get the names of the ten smallest countries in the world (eg. press "1", you will get the smallest country Gibratar). These countries are presented as individual circles and their respective radius is equal to the land area of that country (in km squared).
I got the data from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.TOTL.K2
The name of that perticular CSV file I used is "API_AG.LND.TOTL.K2_DS2_en_csv_v2_937279.csv".
