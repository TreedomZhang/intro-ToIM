**TEN SMALLEST COUNTRIES**

**Description**

In this assignment, you can press keys (1,2,3....9,0) to get the names of the ten smallest countries in the world (eg. press "1", you will get the smallest country-Gibratar; press "0", you will get the tenth smallest country-Aruba). These countries are presented as individual circles and their respective radius is equal to the land area of that country (in km squared). These circles (countries) have the same yPos which is height/2, while their xPos(s) are mapped with reference to their land area (generally the smaller the country, the lefter it will show on the screen). 
I got the data from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.TOTL.K2
The name of that perticular CSV file I used is "API_AG.LND.TOTL.K2_DS2_en_csv_v2_937279.csv".

**Bugs Remain Unsolved**
What I wanted to achieve is that each time I press one key, the circle/country will appear in its position. However, each time I press the key, there will be two identical circles appearing on the screen, with one on the wrong position and the other on the right position but requires continuous pressing to show on the screen. Here is the video that reflects the problem.![vedio](https://youtu.be/s9oT7UJ3ni8)
